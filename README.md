# Music-Listening-Data-Analysis-Using-Hadoop-MapReduce
 The project analyzes music listening data from XYZ.com using MapReduce to extract key insights: number of unique listeners, track shares, radio plays, total listens, and skips. It processes large datasets efficiently, counting and aggregating actions per track for valuable user interaction analysis.
"XYZ.com is an online music website where users listen to various tracks, the data gets collected (download music log data from net) and perform the following: 
Write a MapReduce program to get the following 
• Number of unique listeners 
• Number of times the track was shared with others 
• Number of times the track was listened to on the radio 
• Number of times the track was listened to in total 
• Number of times the track was skipped on the radio
